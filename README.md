# 3dboids
Implementation of Boids using WebGL via THREE.js

## Boids?
Boids are a simulation of swarm/emergent "bird flocking" behaviors originally developed for use in computer graphics.  
For more information (and a better explanation) see: http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/

## What does this do?
This just simulates a few hundred boids in a spherical boundary. You can pan and zoom around with the mouse.

## Future Plans
* Add octree for spaitial locationing to increase performance with more boids.
* Allow insertion of obstacle spheres for some more dynamic events.
